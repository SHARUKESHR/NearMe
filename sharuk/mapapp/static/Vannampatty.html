    Though the name 'Vannampatti' is denoted for the whole village,it is rightly devided in to two parts by a main path that runs north-south wise and the west half(which is originally called vannampatty) has been merged in to the paraipatty panchayat and the east half has been merged (according to the revenue records, it is called 'vellaimalaipatty)in to the veerakkal panchayat.
